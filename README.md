# Linear Algebra in Bend!
This is a WIP library, currently aiming for naive implementations.
At the moment, the goal is to include analogues of GLSL/WGSL types for graphics,
as well as more general (and more easily parallelized) N-dimensional vectors and matrices.

Happy to collaborate so shoot me a DM or open an issue if there's a
feature/refactor/anything you want to add!

Open to name suggestions, this is very much a working title!
